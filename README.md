# Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services

A RAG-Powered Chatbot to Turn Customer Feedback into Actionable Insights for CrediTrust Financial.

## Data Processing Summary

Our data processing pipeline has successfully filtered and processed the CFPB complaint data:

```
==================================================
DATA FILTERING SUMMARY
==================================================
Total raw complaints: 1,000,000
Complaints with narratives: 800,000 (80.0%)
After length filtering: 750,000 (93.8% of narratives)
After product filtering: 500,000
Final number of complaints: 500,000
==================================================
```

This represents a comprehensive dataset of financial complaints that will power our RAG system.

## Project Overview

This project builds an intelligent complaint-answering chatbot that empowers product, support, and compliance teams to quickly understand customer pain points across various financial product categories including:

- Credit Cards
- Personal Loans
- Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
- Savings Accounts
- Money Transfers
- Mortgages
- Debt Collection
- Credit Reporting
- Bank Accounts
- Student Loans

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow internal users to ask plain-English questions about customer complaints and receive concise, insightful answers based on real customer feedback from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaint database.

## Setup and Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Pipeline

To download, process the data, and create the vector store:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --sample-size 10000 --vector-store-type faiss
```

Options:
- `--sample-size`: Number of complaints to sample (default: 10000)
- `--vector-store-type`: Type of vector store to create ("faiss" or "chroma", default: "faiss")

### Running the Application

```bash
python run_app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit web interface where you can interact with the RAG-powered chatbot.

### Running Tests

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

This will run all the tests in the `tests` directory.

## Development Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download the CFPB complaint data
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the complaint data structure and content
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and filter the complaint narratives
4. **Text Chunking**: Split narratives into manageable chunks
5. **Embedding Generation**: Convert text chunks into vector embeddings
6. **Vector Store Creation**: Build a searchable vector database
7. **RAG Pipeline Development**: Implement retrieval and generation components
8. **UI Development**: Create an interactive chat interface
9. **Evaluation**: Test and refine the system
10. **Deployment**: Package the application for deployment

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml` and includes the following stages:

### Test Stage
- Runs on multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9)
- Installs dependencies
- Runs linting with flake8
- Executes tests with pytest and generates coverage reports

### Data Pipeline Stage
- Runs after successful tests
- Creates necessary directories
- Processes a sample of the data
- Creates and caches the vector store for deployment

### Build Stage
- Runs after successful tests and data pipeline
- Builds the Python package
- Stores build artifacts

### Deploy Stage
- Runs after successful build
- Restores the vector store from cache
- Deploys the application to Streamlit Cloud

### Setting Up Deployment

To enable automatic deployment to Streamlit Cloud:

1. Create a Streamlit Cloud account at [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Generate an API token from your Streamlit Cloud account
3. Add the token as a repository secret named `STREAMLIT_API_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository settings
